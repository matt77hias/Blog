After being asked, one month into my senior year, whether I considered pursuing a PhD in computer graphics, I felt quite privileged. Having the prospect of starting a PhD felt like the smoothest possible transition from a master towards an industrial career in computer graphics. It also completely relieved me from the stress of having to worry about the industry just yet.

So it happened. October (2015), the start of an educational and inspiring period in which I could further develop my analysis and problem-solving skills, while being valued as a professional researcher from day one, and being able to fulltime work and conduct research in the domain I am most passionate about. But most importantly, given that one can only learn a very general but small subset in a computer science master, I also had the opportunity and time to learn many new things, being it through self-study, being it from peers, or from attending conferences. While being surrounded by brilliant minds passionate about computer graphics, however, it sometimes felt like living on oneâ€™s own island or gradually building my own ivory tower, as even something as niche as computer graphics or rendering for the outside world or just computer scientists from other disciplines, could not be more fragmented and hyperspecialized.

A key skill of a PhD researcher consists of recognizing whether something is worth exploring or likely a dead-end. This is less trivial than it sounds. There is only a finite time window, substantial progress and progress reports are expected along the way, and in the end it all bottles down to actual scientific publications. So starting over and over with a clean sheet is not always the most viable solution, or stated differently as I once heard: *as a PhD researcher one is allowed to fail, but that does not mean that one can fail*.

I stayed put, determined to complete my work on ADSs, and wrote it all down in a single [paper](https://matt77hias.github.io/res/Publications/Moulin2018-1/Publication.html). Conceptually interesting, but not of much practical use. If the results would have been more promising, it maybe could have been partitioned into multiple separate publications. Finishing the research and the manuscript was the easiest part. The review period, on the other hand, was something else. There is nothing wrong with the review process or whatsoever, and I am very grateful for the feedback and suggestions of the reviewers, leading up to the final version. But all the iterations together comprised such a long period (*which is a difference between direct submissions to journals and indirect submissions through conferences*), making it difficult to completely set oneâ€™s mind on something new, as each iteration always required to go back. And once the final iteration was accepted, the feeling was dual. On the one hand, it gave me peace of mind. On the other hand, I was not really fond of the prospect of going through this again and again for other future papers.

Having successfully finished all the milestones of my doctoral programme before the submission of the dissertation manuscript, and having fulfilled the most important requirements (including a peer-reviewed scientific journal publication), I am still far from reaching my own goals, as after all a PhD is still a personal prestige project. The world would not become a better place, I did not aspire to an academic career, and no one that matters would see me differently with or without a PhD degree. While being proud of my [ADS](https://matt77hias.github.io/res/Publications/Moulin2018-1/Publication.html) (and also [VCT](https://matt77hias.github.io/res/Publications/Moulin2019-1/Publication.html)) work, I have written down everything I wanted to say. There is no point in prolonging the reporting till the point it becomes all that remains, let alone (partially) dedicate my hypothetical dissertation to it.

Furthermore, one confronting observation is the periodic nature of the academic world. Of course, no matter where you go, each year, there will be a New Year's Day, Christmasâ€™ Day etc., but in academics it always felt way more periodic and repetitive especially due to the presence of the education component. And since students keep their age, every year was only a constant reminder that I was getting old.

> I have lost track of how long I have been here, and how many visits I have made overall. Certainly, the landmarks are now so familiar to me that I have to remind myself to actually see the forms and shapes in front of me. I could stumble blind across these rocks, the edges of these precipices, without fear of missing my step and plummeting down to sea. Besides, I have always considered that if one is to fall, it is critical to keep oneâ€™s eyes firmly open.

For all the wrong and right reasons, I decided to leave the academic world early and make my first steps in the industry, with the idea of continuing my PhD in my spare time. Having the solicitation process started in August (2018), it was not until November (*i.e., Swedish summer, central HR not being in a hurry, etc.*), I got the actual offer to join Frostbite Rendering. In January (2018), with a one-way ticket in my hand (which is a weird experience on its own), I ended up in a dark and snowy Stockholm (*the grass was not greener but rather white on the other side*).

While my promotor, assessors and doctoral school all respected and supported my decision, I think we all knew that this was merely the announcement of my future quitting. A fulltime job for a game company with game studios in different time zones all over the world, is not really compatible with much quality leisure time allowing me to work with a clear and fresh mind on a PhD. Furthermore, the decision to rewrite [MAGE](https://github.com/matt77hias/MAGE) from the ground up using D3D12, while improving, extending and changing literally everything along the way, was more regression than progression (*I could definitely relate to some of my former master thesis students and fellow colleagues*) and very time consuming, and is in fact still ongoing. In addition, my rendering work at Frostbite itself contributed to the visual quality of games, but was not worth publishing as it mostly consisted of implementing existing state-of-the-art techniques instead of doing actual new rendering R&D.

So letâ€™s be honest. While being enrolled as a PhD student for 5 years, I did not consider myself finishing my PhD in the foreseeable future in such a way that lives up to my own expectations. Nor did I want my PhD to drag on for many years to come. Nevertheless, I am grateful for the many opportunities I have been given during the doctoral programme, which in any case represented enormous added value for my interests and further career, but also for myself as a person. Being a perfectionist, though, it sometimes felt like a failure of not finishing what I started, or felt like some non-existing, non-equilibrium state between the ones who never pursued a PhD and the ones who completed a PhD. But after a sort of voluntarily *pilgrimage* to Sweden, amidst an ongoing global pandemic, while the world kept spinning, I think I found some closure.
