# Partitiong Schemes

Given some geometric primitives in a scene, it is possible to partition and organize these primitives in multiple ways in a hierarchical or non-hierarchical data structure to exploit spatial coherence during ray tracing. We can partition the geometric primitives into two or more disjoint groups without taking the scene (explicitly) into consideration during the partitioning itself. Or we can do the complete opposite by partitioning the scene's space into two or more disjoint groups without taking the geometric primitives (explicitly) into consideration during the partitioning itself. Or we can use a combination of these two extremes. More formerly:
* *Spatial partitioning schemes* (recursively) subdivide a given space into spatially disjoint groups. This makes an efficient ray traversal possible at the expense of referencing geometric primitives multiple times.
* *Object partitioning schemes* (recursively) subdivide a given set of geometric primitives into disjoint groups which tightly comprise their geometric primitives. Geometric primitives are referenced just once at the expense of a less efficient ray traversal in case of spatially overlapping groups.
* *Hybrid partitioning scheme*s combine both spatial and object partitioning schemes.

For *closest-hit ray queries* (e.g., camera rays, indirect rays, etc.), we want to find the closest hit point of rays with the scene. Therefore, the most efficient traversal of a ray through the acceleration data structure is a front-to-back ray traversal. Such a traversal is trivially to achieve for spatial partitioning schemes, but not for object partitioning schemes due to the possible spatial overlapping between the different groups of geometric primitives. 

*Any-hit ray queries* (e.g., shadow rays) do not care about the closest hit point, any hit point will do. The efficient traversal of any-hit queries, however, is a completely different story beyond the scope of this post.

# Acceleration Data Structures for Ray Tracing

Various *acceleration data structures* exist for exploiting spatial coherence during ray tracing. The faster these structures can be traversed and the less geometric primitives that need to be tested for intersection by rays, the more effective these structures are. Currently, the most effective acceleration data structures are hierarchical, adaptive tree structures of which the leaf nodes reference the geometric primitives and the internal nodes contain spatial information (i.e. splitting plane position, bounding box) to cull the associated part of the scene.

I will give a short overview of some of these structures, and more particularly the considered *candidate partitions*. Assuming a top-down tree construction, we start with a voxel containing all the geometric primitives that need to be partitioned, and an associated AABB (e.g., the AABB of the complete scene or the AABB of a highly tesselated model). We typically propose a certain number of candidate partitions for the current parent voxel which consists of all child voxels (i.e. the AABB constituting the voxel and the geometric primitives contained in that voxel). We select the best one according to some heuristic/cost function (e.g., SAH) and then decide whether we apply that best candidate partition (i.e. create an intermediate node) or not (i.e. create a leaf node).

As we will see, the structure of these candidate partitions differ between different acceleration data structures. But in all cases, a candidate partition is completely determined given a parent voxel and a splitting plane. For object partitioning schemes, the geometric primitives are mapped to their centroids (or an other point) to determine the positioning relative to the splitting plane.

## (Binary) Space Partition - BSP

* spatial partitioning scheme
* hierarchical
* binary/*n*-ary tree
* (non-)axis-aligned voxels

In case of a binary tree with axis-aligned voxels, the BSP is called a *kd-tree* or *rectilinear BSP*.

##### Geometric primitives of the child voxels
* Geometric primitives whose AABB is to the left of the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span> belong to the <span style="color:green;">left</span> child voxel. 
* Geometric primitives whose AABB is to the right of the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span> belong to the <span style="color:red;">right</span> child voxel. 
* Geometric primitives whose AABB is straddling the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span> belong to both child voxels.

##### AABBs of the child voxels
The AABB of both child voxels can be trivially calculated given the <span style="color:blue;">parent</span> voxel and the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span>. The spatial union of the AABB of both child voxels is equal to the <span style="color:blue;">parent</span> voxel (none of the six surrounding planes is tight).

*Split clipping* is a possible optimization (i.e. clipping the geometric primitives against the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span> and/or the AABB of the <span style="color:blue;">parent</span> voxel). It is possible that the AABB of a geometric primitive straddles the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span>, but the actual geometric primitive only lies on one side of the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span>. It is even possible that the AABB of a geometric primitive overlaps with a <span style="color:blue;">parent</span> voxel, but not the geometric primitive associated with this AABB.

##### Geometric primitives of the child voxels
* Geometric primitives to the left of the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span> belong to the <span style="color:green;">left</span> child voxel. 
* Geometric primitives to the right of the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span> belong to the <span style="color:red;">right</span> child voxel. 
* Geometric primitives straddling the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span> belong to both child voxels.
* Geometric primitives lying outside the <span style="color:blue;">parent</span> voxel belong to none of the child voxels.

##### AABBs of the child voxels
The AABB of both child voxels can be trivially calculated given the <span style="color:blue;">parent</span> voxel and the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span>. The spatial union of the AABB of both child voxels is equal to the <span style="color:blue;">parent</span> voxel (none of the six surrounding planes is tight).

* (+) $$\mathcal{O}\left(N \log N\right)$$ full sweeping-plane SAH build algorithm is possible for constructing complete BSPs.
* (+) $$\mathcal{O}\left(N \log N\right)$$ binned SAH build algorithm for constructing complete BSPs (in parallel) is possible.

While observing the image of a BSP candidate partition, we clearly see the AABBs associated with the <span style="color:blue;">parent</span>, <span style="color:green;">left</span> and <span style="color:red;">right</span> child voxel. A candidate partition is, however, only a conceptual thing to compare different acceleration data structures against each other. The obtained BSPs and kd-trees after construction do not store the AABBs associated with each node. First of all, this would increase the memory footprint. Assume that an AABB consists of 6x 32-bit floating point values (24 bytes) and we have $$2^{30}$$ nodes. This results in 24 Gbytes for the AABBs alone. This is clearly something we want to avoid given that BSPs already suffer from high memory usage due to reference duplication for geometric primitives straddling a <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span>. Furthermore, if we really wanted the AABB of a particular node, we can construct it starting from the AABB of the root node (this is the only AABB we explicitly store) and the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span>s (i.e. split position and split axis) found along the way while traversing the tree from the root node to our target node. So how do we traverse such a tree without AABBs? We just start at the root node and test the ray for intersection with the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span>. Depending on the result, we only need to traverse the <span style="color:green;">left</span>, <span style="color:red;">right</span> or both child voxels in front-to-back order along the ray. This ray-plane intersection test is also much cheaper than a ray-AABB intersection test.

## GK-BVH

* spatial partitioning scheme
* hierarchical
* binary/*n*-ary tree
* (non-)axis-aligned voxels
* 6 planes of the voxels are tight, but constrained by the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span>

<p align="center"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/01qkt.jpg"></p>

##### Geometric primitives of the child voxels
* Geometric primitives to the left of the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span> belong to the <span style="color:green;">left</span> child voxel. 
* Geometric primitives to the right of the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span> belong to the <span style="color:red;">right</span> child voxel. 
* Geometric primitives straddling the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span> belong to both child voxels.
* Geometric primitives lying outside the <span style="color:blue;">parent</span> voxel belong to none of the child voxels.

##### AABBs of the child voxels
The AABBs of the child voxels are made tight to the geometric primitives, but the plane corresponding to the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span> can only be moved to the <span style="color:green;">left</span> (<span style="color:red;">right</span>) for the <span style="color:green;">left</span> (<span style="color:red;">right</span>) child voxel. So the geometry first needs to be clipped against the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span>. Furthermore, only the overlap with the AABB of the <span style="color:blue;">parent</span> voxel will be used when geometric primitives straddle the AABB of the <span style="color:blue;">parent</span> voxel.

Originally, I discovered the GK-BVH myself and called it a *Tight BSP* (TBSP) due to its close resemblance to BSPs with regard to the construction. The traversal algorithm, however, is similar to a BVH, explaining the GK-BVH name. The only difference is that geometric primitives can now be associated with multiple leaf nodes and thus the same geometric primitives can be tested multiple times for intersection by the same ray (without using optimizations such as *mailboxing*). This also implies that the resulting GK-BVH will look differently internally as opposed to BVHs, where the latter can just reorganize the geometric primitives in place and the former will depend on an extra indirection (i.e. indices).

* (-) $$\mathcal{O}\left(N \log N\right)$$ full sweeping-plane SAH build algorithm is **not** possible for constructing complete GK-BVHs due to the involved clipping operations.
* (+) $$\mathcal{O}\left(N \log N\right)$$ binned SAH build algorithm for constructing complete GK-BVHs (in parallel) is possible.

We can also clip the AABBs instead of the geometric primitives, which is similar to the difference between kd-trees built with and without split clipping.

##### Geometric primitives of the child voxels
* Geometric primitives whose AABB is to the left of the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span> belong to the <span style="color:green;">left</span> child voxel. 
* Geometric primitives whose AABB is to the right of the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span> belong to the <span style="color:red;">right</span> child voxel. 
* Geometric primitives whose AABB is straddling the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span> belong to both child voxels.

##### AABBs of the child voxels
The AABBs of the child voxels are made tight to the AABBs of the geometric primitives, but the plane corresponding to the <span style="color:purple;">splitting plane</span> can only be moved to the <span style="color:green;">left</span> (<span style="color:red;">right</span>) for the <span style="color:green;">left</span> (<span style="color:red;">right</span>) child voxel. Furthermore, only the overlap with the AABB of the <span style="color:blue;">parent</span> voxel will be used when geometric primitives straddle the AABB of the <span style="color:blue;">parent</span> voxel.

* (+) $$\mathcal{O}\left(N \log N\right)$$ full sweeping-plane SAH build algorithm is possible for constructing complete GK-BVHs due to the involved clipping operations.
* (+) $$\mathcal{O}\left(N \log N\right)$$ binned SAH build algorithm for constructing complete GK-BVHs (in parallel) is possible.

GK-BVHs are, however, tighter since they perform clipping operations on the geometric primitives (and thus not on their less tighter AABBs). Therefore, GK-BVHs will typically have a smaller geometric reference duplication. The only benefit of not clipping the geometric primitives, but the AABBs instead, is a faster build algorithm and the potential of still being able to use a full sweeping-plane SAH build algorithm in a similar fashion to the way BVHs can be built. The traversal will however be the same as for the GK-BVH, and will thus be the same as for the BVH as well. And the traversal of the latter is more efficient in case of less overlap between the AABBs of the child voxels. Since the tightness of GK-BVHs is larger than your acceleration data structure, GK-BVHs will outperform them.

## Spatial Split Bounding Volume Hierarchy - SBVH

* hybrid partitioning scheme
* hierarchical
* binary/*n*-ary tree
* (non-)axis-aligned voxels
* combination of BVH and GK-BVH candidate partitions

<p align="center"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0IkdU.jpg"></p>

SBVHs are built with a combination of a BVH and GK-BVH candidate partions.

* (-) $$\mathcal{O}\left(N \log N\right)$$ full sweeping-plane SAH build algorithm is **not** possible for constructing complete SBVHs due to the inclusion of GK-BVH candidate partitions (*see above*).
* (+) $$\mathcal{O}\left(N \log N\right)$$ binned SAH build algorithm for constructing complete SBVHs (in parallel) is possible.

Since, GK-BVHs will be traversed similarly to BVHs, nothing is stopping us from combining GK-BVH and BVH candidate partitions. The original goal was including some spatial splitting in the BVH construction to have the best of both worlds: the compactness of BVHs and the spatial awareness of BSPs. The best BVH candidate partition and the best BSP candidate partition are found per split decision; both using their variant of the SAH. But how do we select the best of these two to obtain one best candidate partition? If we just compare the SAH costs, the BVH candidate partition will be selected in nearly all cases and we end up with a BVH acceleration data structure. Since, the child voxels of a BVH candidate partition are tight which is not the case for the child voxels of a BSP candidate partition, the SAH cost will be lower since the surface area of the child voxels will be smaller. The solution is to make the BSP candidate partition as tight as possible. This way we obtain the GK-BVH candidate partition, which allows for a fairer comparison against BVH candidate partitions (compared to BSP candidate partitions).

Besides being a hybrid of BVH and GK-BVH candidate partitions, the SBVH is more flexible than a GK-BVH. The best candidate partition can be refined if geometric primitives are contained in both child voxels. Each such primitive can be added to the <span style="color:green;">left</span>, <span style="color:red;">right</span> or both child voxels. After iterating these geometric primitives, we obtain the final best candidate partition for a single split decision.

If we do not use fancy optimizations such as LBVHs which uses spatial Morton coding to organize the BVH. The SBVH is conceptually the most effective acceleration data structure presented here so far, offering the best of both worlds (hybrid of spatial and object partitioning schemes). SBVHs were the preferred acceleration data structure of [NVidia OptiX Ray Tracing Engine](https://developer.nvidia.com/optix).
